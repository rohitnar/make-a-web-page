<h1> Important Concepts </h1>
<div class="lesson">
	<h2> Lesson 1: Basics of the WEB & HTML</h2>
	<div class="concept-title"> 
		Definitions
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			WWW: World wide web<br>HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language<br>Hyperlinks: provides links between pages<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title"> How it all ties together
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			You (through your browser) access the internet which in turn uses the HTTP (protocol) to access the various servers to access the information in the servers
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title"> HMTL is made up of
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			- Text content
			<br>- mark ups
			<br>- references to (images, videos or other web pages)
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title"> HTML Mark Up
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			It comprises of opening tag and closing tag and the whole sequence is called element
			<br>
			B is used for <b>Bold</b>
			<br>
			Em is used for <em>italics</em>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="concept-title">HTML Attributes
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			"a" is used for Anchor which links the specific words to another webpage. For instance below
			<br>
			"img" is used for Images 
			<br>
			Important point: there are some tags which have no content so have no closing tags. These are also called <b> "VOID TAGS"</b>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title">White Space
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			All spaces in HTML are white spaces so unless specific commands are used, it will be presumed that everything is written in a flow.<br>
			"br" is line break
			<br>
			"p" is for one paragraph
			<br>
			The difference between the two is that while one is inline and other is a block.The block clubs all the words inside it as one cluster

<h2>Lesson 2: Creating a structured document with HTML </h2>
	<div class="concept-title"> Developer tools (in a browser) 
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the contents inside it. So you can use th whole box to style it together.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title">
		Tree like structure of HTML
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			Comes from the fact that HTML elemnets can have other elements inside of them. You can draw a relationship like a family tree
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title">
		Text Editors
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like sublime text for instance). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag with an opening tag.
		</p>
	</div>

<h2> Lesson 3: Adding CSS style to HTML structure
</h2>
	<div class="concept-title"> What is CSS
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="concept-title"> How to use CSS
	</div>
	<div class="concept-description">
		<p>
			For big projects its best to use CSS to avoid repetitions and thereby programming errors. To use CSS you have to link your html file to a seperate CSS file as per steps below
			<br>
			1. Write all your structured HTML in one file
			<br>
			2. In a seperate file, put all your CSS code
			<br>
			3. Add a head element to the top of the HTML file and add a link tag inside the head element to link the CSS file to the HMTL file.
